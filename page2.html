                    <h1>The app teaching style</h1>
                    <p2>We are using the same style we talked about in Revision 1: Hiragana. In case you missed it we will be using a progressive system of teaching the kana. As you learn new kana, we will immediately replcase the roman letter(Romaji) with the kanna you just learnt. For example, after you've learned あ we will mix it inot the example word:</p2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>What is a stroke?</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p2> A stroke being when the pen(or any other writing device) meets the paper. The stroke ends when the pen separates from the paper.</p2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Why use brushes write?</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p2>Traditionally, Japanese was written with brushes. Almost every Jpanese learning material uses the brush wirtten style for Jpanese characters. The brush style us the best representaion on how the chracter should be written</p2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The different type of brush strokes.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p2>There are thress types of strokes. For each of understanding we have named them fade out, dead stop and bounce fade. Whether writing with a brush, pen or pencil, make sure that you pay attention to the stroke type. This will ensure that your writing is neat and proper.</p2>
